# Jump start your next MVP with Slim Framework and this handy set of solutions to common problems.  

This project is for anyone wanting to build a web app or web service MVP using 
[Slim Framework](http://slimframework.com), running on PHP, MySQL, and memcache. 
I created it to help [myself](http://twitter.com/collegeman) and [my company](http://fatpandadev.com) go faster,
and now you can use it too!

Ready to get started? [Go, go, go](#getting-started).

## A little history.

I like dreaming about products I want to build. And most of the time when I'm dreaming about
products, I'm dreaming about SaaS. Afterall, I've been writing code for the Web a long time.

When I first picked up PHP it was because it was free and Microsoft wasn't. Later, when
PHP became the focus of my development, it was because PHP was far easier than Java
for building iteratively and testing.

That was before I discovered CodeIgniter, WordPress, and countless other amazing open
source projects and communities. All of them were born of this wonderful and sometimes 
frustrating language we call PHP. I was hooked.

Sometime last year I discovered [Slim Framework](http://slimframework.com), and I felt emboldened 
by its simplicity. Not long after that I discovered [Paris and Idiorm](http://j4mie.github.io/idiormandparis/), 
both of which have also became reliable tools in my belt.

Later that same year as I was working to build two different MVPs for two different companies,
I decided that there were enough similarities between the two projects to justify creating
a "common" repository of code to share between the two.

And with that, **slim-common** was born.

## What slim-common is

### slim-common is a package of solutions

I started by solving some common lower-level problems: things like how to manage configuration. But
soon I moved on to larger challenges&mdash;challenges that required me to incorporate third-party
libraries like the Facebook PHP SDK. More challenging though they may be, the problems I was solving were still
*common* problems, so into the library went Facebook's code.

### slim-common provides these essential toolkits/solutions:

* the [Slim Framework](https://github.com/codeguy/Slim) core
* configuration management
* credit card processing ([Stripe](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php))
* [Facebook API integration](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk)
* [Google API integration](https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client)
* HTTP requests ([Requests](https://github.com/rmccue/Requests))
* markdown rendering
* newsletter management ([MailChimp](http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/api/mcapi_php_changelog.php))
* remote content embedding ([Embed.ly](http://embed.ly))
* sending transactional e-mails ([Mandril](https://packagist.org/packages/mandrill/mandrill))
* sending and receiving SMS messages ([Twilio](http://twilio.com))
* UI patterns ([Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com))
* user authentication and security

## What slim-common is not

### slim-common does not use composer

This was *almost* a deliberate decision. 

I like composer, but at the time I was beginning these projects I wasn't familiar with it. 

So instead I have enjoyed relying on git submodules for managing dependencies, and I still do. 
Of course, this makes any project you build using **slim-common** dependent upon a feature that belongs 
to git, which technically violates the [Dependency](http://12factor.net/dependencies)
factor of the [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/), but only to the extent that to
get started developing with **slim-common** you need to have git installed&mdash;hardly seems
like a big ask.

Maybe one day I'll add a composer description file to **slim-common** and strip out some of
the third-party riders (like the Facebook PHP SDK), but until I have time for that kind of
meta work, I'm going to stick with what gets the job done. 

### slim-common is not an application template

To use **slim-common** you need to *add* it to your own project, just as if it were a 
giant library of code, because in fact it is a giant library of code. There's a little bit
of setup, and then there's a four-line index.php file you need to create, and then you're
off to the races!

That said, this library does contain some templated code that you can use to quickstart your own app.

# Getting Started

You'll need a runtime containerâ€”Apache or something else. Also, to make the most of the framework, 
you'll need MySQL and memcache. On my laptop I'm running OSX 10.8.5 (I need to upgrade). 
I use the copy of Apache that comes with the Mac, and I use [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/)
to install PHP, MySQL, and memcache.

How you setup your runtime container is entirely up to you, but the following instructions
do assume that you'll make the webroot of your app a folder inside your app called `./htdocs`&mdash;
don't worry about creating that folder yourself, as there's a step below in which we do
it by copying templates from common into your app.

Next, create a local folder in which to do your work. Switch to that folder, and initialize your 
local git repository. Then add **slim-common** as a submodule:

    your-app > git submodule add git@github.com:collegeman/slim-common common

Copy the templates from `common/htdocs` into the root of your project:

    your-app > cp -R common/templates/* ./

If you already have a `.gitignore` file, add `config.php` to the list. If you
don't have a `.gitignore` file, you can copy the one from common into your
own project:

    your-app > cp common/templates/.gitignore ./

Optionally, change directory into your new `./htdocs` folder, and setup a symlink 
for the CSS and JS packages that ride along with common

    your-app > cd htdocs
    your-app/htdocs > ln -s common/htdocs common

Last step: you need to set your `AUTH_SALT` config setting in `./config.php`. The
value you put in that constant will be used for encrypting things like passwords.
You can easily generate a random key [here](http://randomkeygen.com/).
Until you do that, all requests to your app will result in an error message.

Is it working? If you request the following URL

    /working

and you see the following output

    Yep. It's working.

Then you have succeeded. Happy coding!

## It's not working?

### I'm seeing a 404

Make sure that the file `./htdocs/.htaccess` exists in your project path. The contents of the file should be as follows:

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
    RewriteRule ^ - [L]
    RewriteRule . index.php [L]

### I'm seeing something else

If you're not seeing any error messages, the first thing you should do is check your PHP error log.

If you're seeing this error in the log:

    PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'Please set auth.salt config var to a strong key'

Then you skipped that step about setting your `AUTH_SALT` in `./config.php`. Do that now.

If you're seeing some other error message, please [open an issue](https://github.com/collegeman/slim-common/issues) and report the problem.

If you're not seeing any error messages, you probably need to check the health of your runtime container.

Can't get it working? [Open an issue](https://github.com/collegeman/slim-common/issues)&mdash;depending upon the nature of your problem, I am available for consulting.

## Routing requests

You'll find a couple of pre-configured routes in `./dispatcher.php`. The default routes include:

* **/info** &mdash; Executes `phpinfo()`
* **/server** &mdash; Pretty-prints the contents of `$_SERVER`
* **/working** &mdash; "Yep. It's working."

The **/info** and **/server** routes won't work until you setup MySQL and user ACL features.

[Read about how to use routing](http://docs.slimframework.com/#Routing-Overview) in the documentation for Slim Framework.

# Configuration management

First and foremost, remember that the [third principle](http://12factor.net/config) of the 
[12 factor app](http://12factor.net/) is to store config in the environment.

If you didn't do it when you were getting started, make sure that the local `./config.php` 
file is ignored by git&mdash;you don't want to version control your local 
configuration file, or any configuraiton file for that matter.

The config system built-into **slim-common** is simple and flexible. 

A global function
`config($name, $default)` can be called in any context for loading a configuration
value named `$name`. You should express `$name` in lowercase, using a dot notation
to separate groups of configuration values, e.g., `"db1.host"`. Use the optional
second argument `$default` to specify a default value to return in the even that
configuration key `$name` does not exist.

The config system will first look at constants for config values&mdash;this makes
it possible to use the PHP file `./config.php` to store configuration in code. 
A configuration key named `"db1.host"` would be found in a constant named `DB1_HOST`&mdash;
all uppercase, and the dots are replaced by underscores.

Next the config system will search the `$_SERVER` scope. Here the name is converted
just as it is for the constant-based configuration pattern: `"db1.host"` would be
found in `$_SERVER['DB1_HOST']`. This is my preferred method of configuration as it
allows me to store config with the runtime container&mdash;in the case of Apache,
in `<VirtualHost>` blocks using the `SetEnv` directive. You can read more about
`SetEnv` [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10902433/setting-environment-variables-for-accessing-in-php)
and [here](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_env.html).

The third and final place the config system will look is in the Slim Framework
application configuration via `Slim::config()` which you can read more about
[here](http://docs.slimframework.com/#Configuration-Overview).
